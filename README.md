### Railway

Bring your code, we'll handle the rest. Made for any language, for projects big and small. [Railway](https://railway.app/) 
is the cloud that takes the complexity out of shipping software.

Create a new empty project in Railway and start by creating a PostgreSQL database. Once you have that created you can create
a new project from GitHub. You can use the following environment variables based on the database you just created. 

```properties
	spring_profiles_active=prod
	PROD_DB_HOST=containers-us-west-168.railway.app
	PROD_DB_PORT=7303
	PROD_DB_NAME=railway
	PROD_DB_PASSWORD=Nycb62Gq4KlYhhUBjmCR
	PROD_DB_USERNAME=root
	
	MYSQLDATABASE=railway
	MYSQLHOST=containers-us-west-168.railway.app
	MYSQLPASSWORD=Nycb62Gq4KlYhhUBjmCR
	MYSQLPORT=7303
	MYSQLUSER=root
	
```
