### Railway

Bring your code, we'll handle the rest. Made for any language, for projects big and small. [Railway](https://railway.app/) 
is the cloud that takes the complexity out of shipping software.

Create a new empty project in Railway and start by creating a PostgreSQL database. Once you have that created you can create
a new project from GitHub. You can use the following environment variables based on the database you just created. 

```properties
spring_profiles_active=prod
PROD_DB_HOST=containers-us-west-166.railway.app
PROD_DB_PORT=6973
PROD_DB_NAME=railway
PROD_DB_PASSWORD=GdZY9P2ZuCRNi3zLsZMW
PROD_DB_USERNAME=postgres
```
